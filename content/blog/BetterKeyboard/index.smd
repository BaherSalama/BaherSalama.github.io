## The 16-Key Titan: Building a Layered RP2040 Keyboard with Combos
### How I built a pocket-sized, layer-driven keyboard for coding, gaming, and everything in between.
I designed a chording keyboard where combinations and layers turn 16 keys
- Base Layer: Letters, numbers, functions, navigation, all via combos.
- Gaming Layer: WASD.

it's been my daily driver for a year, And it can't get any better except in gaming might need some tweeks other than that it's golden no rsi for me :)
### how about the speed?
